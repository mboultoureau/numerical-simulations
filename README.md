# Numerical simulations

Assignment for the "Cryptography and probabilities" course at ENSSAT.

- Part 1: the aim is to implement RSA encryption and decryption. This involves implementing algorithms for fast exponentiation, calculating BÃ©zout coefficients, checking whether a number is prime and calculating the PGCD. The message is represented as a number, and encryption and decryption are tested.
